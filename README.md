# ask-task

Nowadays, when a question pops into your head, the first place you go is the internet, as it is filled to the brim with resources that can give you the information you are looking for. One of them being AskTask. AskTask is a question-and-answer website where people go to find information. Every piece of content on the site is generated by users, meaning it is created, edited, and organized by the same people that use the website.

After hearing that description of AskTask, you might be thinking, “Well why don’t I just use an everyday search engine?” I’ll tell you why. It has some qualities :

- It allows users to create social networks and follow topics that interest them.
- It focuses on high-quality questions and answers.
- It enables users to vote on answers to highlight the most accurate information possible.

## Using

- _**React** : For Front-End_
- _**Redux** : For State Management Tools_
- _**Firebase** : For Back-End_
- _**Material-UI** : For Icons_


## **Step #1: Project initialization and configuration**

You guys have to open the terminal of your Code Editor and fire the command. ``` npx create-react-app asktask — template redux ```. It will generate the boiler plate react project from where you can start building your project.


## **Step #2: Installing dependencies**

Here is the least of dependencies you guys have to install from the terminal using npm .

1. @material-ui/core
2. @material-ui/core
3. firebase
4. react-flip-move
5. react-modal

To install these dependencies you have to fire the command ```npm install _dependencies name_ ```


## **Step #3: Start Building the Components**

We will build the functional components and will implement the concept of HOOKS to achieve the full fledged UI and Functionality.
To generate the snippets of functional component inside the Visual Studio Code. You guys have to first install the extension from the marketplace inside the IDE named **ES6/REACT/REDUX/GraphQL** snippets.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
